## Project Description and Goal Statement
The AR (Accounts Receivable) can be a source of financial difficulties for companies when they are not managed efficiently.
This project aims to demonstrate how Supervised Machine Learning can help to predict the outcome of payment of invoices that have not yet been paid (outstanding) based on historical data.
The method used can predict with high accuracy in which age bucket (on time, 1-15, 16-30, over 30) invoices will be paid.
This approach enables the creation of more efficient workflows based on payment behaviour thus increasing collections effectiveness.

## Dataset
This data was provided by IBM for testing out their analytics tools. Source: Kaggle.


## Workflow
Steps for the project:
- Research the topic and find a relevant dataset.
- Come up with a research question and testable hypotheses.
- Data preprocessing.
- Training and evalutating ML models for classification problem.
